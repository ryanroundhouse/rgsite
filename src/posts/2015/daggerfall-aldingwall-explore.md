A little while back I read about the [Daggerfall Tools for Unity project](https://www.dfworkshop.net/).  This made me really happy because I’ve been playing with unity for a few months now and really like how now I have access to all of Daggerfall’s assets to make some more fun games.  <!-- Excerpt Start -->I’ve created a quick demo to allow you to walk around Aldingwall and see how the engine works<!-- Excerpt End -->.
