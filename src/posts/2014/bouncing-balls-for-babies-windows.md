It has actually been on the windows app store for about a month, but I ran into some difficulties because it was listed in Russia, South Korea, and a couple other locales that required a game board rating for listing. I fixed that issue (by removing those locales) but then it took more than a week for microsoft to stop suspending my app. Well, itâ€™s back up, and ready to go. You require a windows 8 or greater OS to install this.

As usual, you can still [get Bouncing Balls for Babies for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.RyanGrahamca.BouncingBallsForBabies) or as [the old XNA game for windows](/projects/bouncing-balls-for-babies-xna/).
