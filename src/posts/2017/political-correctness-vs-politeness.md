I’ve become a huge fan of the [‘School of Life’ youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/schooloflifechannel).  They make a ton of 5-12 minute videos outlining lessons from philosophers, artists, political scientists, as well as tackling general topics such as ‘The purpose of friendship’ and ‘How to be warm’.

They also have a website called the Book of Life.  I’m on their mailing list, and occasionally, they send me an article that interests me.  The reason I’m such a fan of this is that I find they do a great job of verbalizing how I feel when I can’t find the words myself.

The latest article I read was one entitled [Political Correctness vs. Politeness](https://www.thebookoflife.org/political-correctness-vs-politeness/).  <!-- Excerpt Start -->It explores the problems some people have with political correctness and offers the idea of politeness as an alternative.<!-- Excerpt End -->

Give it a read.
