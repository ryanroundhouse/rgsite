When playing Daggerfall with my friend Jason back in the day, we had to choose a hometown.  We ended up choosing Aldingwall, located in the Daggerfall province.  Since buying a house was prohibitively expensive, we instead pre-purchased approximately 30 years stay in an inn located in the market district.  This is a demo project I made, following the daggerfall tools for unity tutorials (which are really well written… I’m not used to seeing good documentation for indy projects).  It is the city of Aldingwall, which you can explore.
