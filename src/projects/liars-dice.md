## Description
[Liar's dice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar%27s_dice) is a class of dice games for two or more players requiring the ability to deceive and to detect an opponent's deception.

## Repositories
The [Backend](https://github.com/ryanroundhouse/ts-socket) is implemented in node.js.  It makes use of express for the API and ws for websockets for synchronous communication.  It's written in primarily typescript.

## Developer details
This is a fun and simple game that I often use when I'm trying to learn new technologies as I've internalized the rules.  This prevents me from getting stuck trying to figure out requirements when I want to implement a simple multiplayer turn-based game.
