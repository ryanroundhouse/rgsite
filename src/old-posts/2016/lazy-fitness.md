I read a headline on reddit last week: [“LPT: There is a visible difference between not working out at all and doing 15 pushups every day. Make 15 push ups your new ‘not working out’“](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/4yk6f7/lpt_there_is_a_visible_difference_between_not/).  It didn’t convince me to actually read the post, but it convinced me to do 15 pushups a day (this is day 4).  I decided to start changing up the kind of push ups I’ve been doing (tonight was diamond pushups) because <!-- Excerpt Start -->my 15 became 20, which became 25<!-- Excerpt End -->.

After that, I was still feeling pretty lazy, but still wanted to do some yoga (because stretching feels sooo so good).  I googled chair yoga, which was feeling much my style, [this is what came up](https://www.verywell.com/chair-yoga-poses-3567189).  I decided to give it a go.

It was pretty good.  My spine feels limber.  I got some good stretching out into my thighs and arms.  If you’re not going to do anything, maybe just do this.
