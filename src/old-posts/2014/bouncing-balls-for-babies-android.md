It would mean a lot to me if you would install this game (there are NO ads, it request NO access to your information and it is FREE), then give it a rating and review on the play store.

<!-- Excerpt Start -->After about 40 hours or so of development, I’ve completed Bouncing Balls for Babies.<!-- Excerpt End -->  I’ve published it to the Play store, plan to do the same for the windows store, potentially the amazon store, and maybe the apple store.  It depends on my motivation and funds.  I will also be hosting the game on this site soon enough.

In the meantime, here is some gameplay footage of the finished product.

I will still be hosting [the 0.5 version of bouncing balls for babies (built on the Windows XNA framework)](/projects/bouncing-balls-for-babies-xna/).  It’s got its’ own positives and negatives, so I feel it still has some value.
